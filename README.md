# ðŸ§© Escape Maze

Escape Maze is a Flutter app that generates a maze using **Primâ€™s Algorithm**.

The maze is drawn on the screen step-by-step, so you can watch how the algorithm builds it in real-time.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Maze generation using **Prim's Algorithm**
- Animated drawing of the maze
- Shows **time complexity: O(E log V)**
- Easy input: set maze width and height (odd numbers like 11, 15, 21...)

---

## ðŸ“± How to Use

1. Run the app with `flutter run`
2. Enter maze size (width and height)
3. Tap **Start**
4. Watch the maze being generated!

---

## ðŸ’» Built With

- Flutter
- Dart
- CustomPainter
- Primâ€™s Algorithm

---

## ðŸ“š What You Learn

- How Prim's Algorithm works
- Custom drawing with Flutter
- Basic animation and timers

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Use **odd numbers** for width and height (min: 5)
- This is a simple educational project to learn algorithms visually

---

## ðŸ§  Time Complexity

> **O(E log V)** â€“ where:
> - V = number of cells
> - E = number of walls between them

---

## ðŸ”§ Future Ideas

- Add solving animation (e.g., DFS/BFS)
- Add player movement
- Export maze image
